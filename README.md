# R Hotel

## Overview
A comprehensive hotel reservation and management platform hosted on Azure, allowing customers to seamlessly search for room availability, book accommodations via a hotel web portal, and facilitate efficient check-in processes via a desktop app installed in the hotel.

## Creative Inspiration
During my summer vacation in 2024, I traveled to Taipei and stayed at the **CitizenM Hotel**. Using Booking.com to make a reservation, I experienced their seamless check-in process, facilitated by a desktop app in the hotel lobby. Inspired by this system, I set out to create a similar comprehensive hotel reservation and management platform.

## My R Hotel Demonstration

### 1: R Hotel Web Portal

#### 1.1 Searching for Available Rooms and Booking

In this example, we will search for an executive room with a check-in date of **01/13/2025** and a check-out date of **01/15/2025**, and then book the room using the guest's full name. This example also demonstrates input validation while booking, ensuring that a room cannot be rebooked once it has already been booked.

> **Note**:  
> The executive room can only be booked once at a time because there is only one executive room available.  
> In contrast, the king-size room and double queen-size room have three and two rooms available, respectively.  
> In other words, the king-size room can accommodate up to three reservations at the same time, while the double queen-size room can accommodate up to two.

#### 1.2 Viewing the **Booking Table** in the Database After Booking
After confirming the booking, the **BookingsTable** in the database reflects the changes. It stores all reservation details, including the guest's name, room type, and booking dates.

</div>

#### 1.3 Exploring Related Tables in the Database
The portalâ€™s database maintains a structured relationship between various tables. Here's how the **BookingsTable** links to other tables:

##### **a. Guests Table**
The `userId` in the **BookingsTable** maps to the corresponding entry in the **Guests Table**. For instance, `userId 1` is associated with "Run Ji," which was used during the booking process.

</div>

##### **b. Room Type Table**
The `roomId` in the **BookingsTable** maps to the corresponding room type in the **Room Type Table**. For example, `roomId 3` represents the **executive room type**.

</div>

##### **c. Rooms Table**
The `roomNumber` in the **Rooms Table** links back to the room type in the **Room Type Table**. For example, **Room Number 301** is associated with the executive room type, as shown in the **BookingsTable**.

### 2: R Hotel Desktop App Check-in Portal

#### 2.1 Searching for Reservations by Guest Last Name
In this example, we check in a reservation via the desktop app using the guest's last name, "Ji." The app displays reservation details, including the guest's full name, check-in/out dates, assigned room number, and total amount.

</div>

#### 2.2 Viewing the **Booking Table** in the Database After Check-In
Once the guest is checked in, the "Check-in" status in the **BookingsTable** updates from `0` to `1`.

## Key Features

### 1. Stored Procedures with Dapper
Implemented stored procedures to ensure efficient and secure database operations using Dapper, a lightweight and fast ORM. The stored procedures handle tasks such as booking management and data retrieval.

### 2. Generic Programming and Dependency Injection (DI)
Utilized generic programming and dependency injection to create modular, reusable, and testable components. This approach reduces code duplication and enhances maintainability.
